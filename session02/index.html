<p>Why? Well, we’re a motley crew of dreamers and designers who live by a simple creed: <i>“Do more of what you love.”</i></p>

<p>And we love designing things that make life a little bit easier and a heckuva a lot more <i>enjoyable</i>. We asked ourselves, with so many different kinds of water bottles out there, why do 3 out of 4 people still suffer from chronic dehydration?</p>

<p>So we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. We created what we believe to be the finest water bottles in all the land. Water bottles designed to help you do more of what you love. So, what are you waiting for? Go forth and carpe the diem—hydrated <i>like a boss.</i></p>
